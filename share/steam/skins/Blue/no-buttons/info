Thanks for downloading this Ubuntu-Like theme for Steam for Linux.

Special thanks to Alin Andrei (https://plus.google.com/112555004333838485342) for supporting this idea and publishing an article about it on WebUpd8.org

I would also like to thank to Christian Dannie Storgaard (https://plus.google.com/u/0/109112839611372991869) for improving the theme by moving the window buttons to the left side, etc.


You are all awesome for downloading this theme, using it and modifiing it (which, of course, you can :) ).
