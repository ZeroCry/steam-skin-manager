<h3>Installing a Custom skin</h3>
<p>To install a custom skin, you must first extract it. It is highly reommended to put it into a place where it won't be bothering you.</p>

<p>This won't copy the folder, only link it with Steam. If you delete any custom theme and won't backup it, you'll loose it.</p>

<p>If you decide to move your skin folder elsewhere, you'll have to set it here again, which will overwrite previous settings.</p>

<h3>Using 3rd party skins</h3>
<p>Most skins available on the Internet support Microsoft Windows, some Mac OS X. Their appearance may be wrong on Linux. To use them you may have to tweak them a little bit.<br>There is no universal way to accomplish this since every skin may suffer from a different bug.</p>

<p>Please note, some skins work flawlessly on Linux, like <a href="http://boneyardbrew.deviantart.com/art/Metro-for-Steam-2-7-1-292419787">Windows 8 Metro skin</a></p>
