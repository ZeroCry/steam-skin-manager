					<h3>Steam theming standard</h3>
					<p><strong>Steam Skin Manager</strong> is trying to <strong>create a standard for packaging themes/skins</strong>. If you are a developer investigating the ways of presenting your theme(s) to the wider community, you may wish to simplify the installation process e.g. by making your own installer or using this tool.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>There are 2 ways getting your skin working with Steam Skin Manager</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Prepare your skin so users can just extract the whole theme folder and point to it in the Steam Skin Manager custom file chooser dialog.</li>
						<li><strong>Make a package or an installer</strong> that puts your theme to the "/usr/share/steam/skins" directory. * (recommended)</li>
					</ul>
					<p>* So called "Bundled skins", but with the New-Generation not truly bundled, must obey the following rules to be functional:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>Your folder's name placed in the directory is the Skin's name, that appears to the user.</li>
						<li>There <strong>should be two folders inside</strong> your directory, "no-buttons" and "with-buttons".<br>"no-buttons" is the directory without window buttons (this modification is prepared for using native window border) whilst the other folder contains window buttons - maximize,minimize,close - and can be used on it's own with Steam. If you don't intend to create both versions you can omit both folders, however, if you wish to create "no-buttons" version only, you'll have to put the content to the folder of the same name so that Steam Skin Manager can recognize your skin correctly.</li>
						<li><strong>Description in an optional</strong> file, only one per both theme variants, placed in the root directory of your theme. It must be called "description.txt" and can take advantage of some basic html tags, like - bold,italic,underline,link -. It is recommended to keep the description file shorter rather than long.</li>
						<li><strong>Preview is another optional</strong> file and if used it must be called "preview.png". There is again only one file for both variants, located in the root directory of your theme. This should be a screenshot of Steam window with the applied theme. Images are resized to 512x314px when previewed.</li>
					</ol>
