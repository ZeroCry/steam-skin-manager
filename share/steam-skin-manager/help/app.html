				<h3>First Run</h3>
				<p>Steam Skin Manager helps you apply and use custom themes with Steam client. To set a theme, you must be at the Appearance tab. You can either use one of the <a href="bundled.html">bundled themes</a> or you may want to use a different theme, either your own or a downloaded one.</p>
				<p>Using both bundled or <a href="custom.html">custom</a> themes is simple. You only need to select one of the listed Bundled (preinstalled) Skins and hit apply. If you wish to use <a href="decorations.html">native window decorations</a>, then switch on the most upper button.</p>
				<p>If you select a custom skin using the file dialog chooser, Steam Skin Manager will automatically expect you wish to apply a 3rd party skin and will act accordingly. In this case you must have your theme extracted and placed somewhere you wish it to stay. Then select the related skin folder through the dialog and hit apply. <a href="custom.html">Read&nbsp;more&nbsp;&raquo;</a></p>
