<h3>Window decorations</h3>
<p>Window decorations are borders around all application windows. They usually contain close, minimize, maximize buttons and a title.</p>

<p>Steam can't use native decorations on its own as it comes with it's own interface. Find out how to use Steam with system decorations in the <a href="./launcher.html">launcher section</a>.</p>
