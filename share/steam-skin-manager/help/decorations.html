<h3>Window decorations</h3>
<p>Window decorations are borders around all application windows. They contain close, minimize, maximize buttons and a title.</p>

<p>Steam can use native decorations or no decorations, which is the default behaviour. To use Steam with decorations, launch "Steam wb" from the dash or menu.</p>

<p>Using Steam with native window decorations is an experimental feature and may not work or be buggy.</p>
