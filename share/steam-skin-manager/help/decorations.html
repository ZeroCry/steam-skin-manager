					<h3>Window decorations</h3>
					<p>Window decorations are borders around all application windows. They usually contain close, minimize, maximize buttons and a title.</p>

					<p>Steam can't use native decorations on its own as it comes with it's own interface. Find out how to use Steam with system decorations in the <a href="./launcher.html">launcher section</a>.</p>

						<h3>Warning!</h3>
						<p>Using Steam with native window decorations is an <strong>experimental feature</strong> and may not work or be buggy.</p>
