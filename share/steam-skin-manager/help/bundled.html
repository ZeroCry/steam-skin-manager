<h3>Installing a Bundled skin</h3>
<p>Right now the tool comes with two themes in two variants. There are Ubuntu Ambiance and Ubuntu Radiance skins. You can use them both either with or without system window decorations.</p>
<p>To install them, switch to Bundled Skin tab, choose your skin, decide about <a href="./decorations.html">window decorations</a> and Apply.</p>

<h3>Warning!</h3>
<p>To launch Steam with window decorations you'll have to use "Steam wb" item available in your dash or menu.</p>

<h3>Expandability</h3>
<p>If you wish to add your skin to this category, you'll have to follow folder organisation and place it into /usr/shar/steam/skins directory.</p>
