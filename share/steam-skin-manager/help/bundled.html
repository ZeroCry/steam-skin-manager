<h3>Installing a Bundled skin</h3>
<p>Right now the tool comes with two themes in two variants. There are Ubuntu Ambiance and Ubuntu Radiance skins. You can use them both either with or without system window decorations.</p>
<p>To install them, switch to the Appearance tab, choose your skin, decide whether you want to use native <a href="./decorations.html">window decorations</a> and Apply.</p>

<h3>Warning!</h3>
<p>To launch Steam with window decorations you can't use the default Steam launcher, instead you must launch Steam with a hack. Find more in the <a href="./launcher.html">launcher section</a>.</p>

<h3>Expandability</h3>
<p>If you wish to add your skin to this category, you'll have to follow folder organisation and place it into "SteamSkinManager_Directory/share/steam/skins" directory.</p>
